# Nora's Engine
This is the main engine project for Nora and the Lake of Mirrors. 

The code is provided as is, and is built specifically for the game. As such, this engine is not intended to be used by others in their own projects.
Instead, code in this project is free to check and reference if you desire to take its systems for use in your own engine.
